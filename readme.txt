This software is still in the stage of development, so you can run it only in a test mode. 

First of all, you need to build the app with "go build csvParserV1.1.1.go".

Then run the binary file with two arguments - the first is the path to your CSV-file,the second is "all" and commands to parse the whole file.

For example you can parse the CSV-file, which included in this package by: "./csvParserV1.1.1 ./theCSV.csv all"
